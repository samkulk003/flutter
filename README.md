# Cuisine Quest
## It's your passport to global cuisine.

Discover a world of culinary delights with my Meals App, your personal guide to diverse cuisines. Designed specifically for food enthusiasts, this application allows you to explore a variety of dishes from the comfort of your home.

With a multi-screen interface, the Meals App categorizes meals by different cuisines, making it easy for you to navigate and find your next favorite dish. Whether you're craving appetizers or desserts, you'll find a wide selection right at your fingertips.

Understanding the unique dietary needs and preferences of each user, the Meals App provides advanced filter options. Whether you're gluten-free, lactose-free, vegan, or vegetarian, you can customize your search to find meals that suit your lifestyle.

One unique feature of my app is the ability to add meals to 'Favorites'. Keep track of the dishes you love and revisit them whenever you want, with just a tap.

For data storage, the Meals App utilizes Firebase at the backend. This ensures your favorite meals, search history, and personal preferences are stored securely and are accessible at your convenience.
